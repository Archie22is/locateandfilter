Create Maps exactly the way you want using LocateAndFilter. 

== Description ==
LocateAndFilter is a versatile and highly customizable WordPress plugin aimed at creating nice looking searchable/filterable maps.

**Some of the features :**

* **Friendly** : 
LocateAndFilter has been built on the great library LeafletJs (http://leafletjs.com/) and coded with extensibility in mind : addons using LocateAndFilter in conjunction with another WP plugin. You no longer need Google API Key.  
* **Use just any taxonomy as a filter** : Easily use any taxonomy (custom taxonomies or regular taxonomies) to filter your maps.
* **Supports Custom Post Types** : Most of the WordPress plugins only support posts and pages. Not this one!Total support for any custom post type and their taxonomies!
* **Fully customizable marker icons** : You can define a custom marker icon for each location or choose to use the same marker for the whole map. It’s up to you! Choose between the plugin’s predefined marker icons, create your own markers using Ionicon or just use any image from the media library. Total flexibility!
* **Customizable Map Overlay** : Choose between 4 different map overlays… Or use any overlay you want with the Custom Overlay Addon
* **Additional fields** : Need to display a specific info on the map? Create additional fields! Additional fields are custom fields specifically designed to be displayed on the map. Let’s say your map is about coffeshops and you want to show the opening hours and the name of the nearest subway station? Create 2 additional fields : openingHours and nearestSubway. Done! Those informations are ready to be displayed in the marker list and the tooltips.
* **Fully customizable tooltips** : Customize the tooltips EXACTLY as you want them : HTML, audios, videos, images,post content… Tooltips can display nearly anything. Customize the tooltip template for each marker independently, you have total control on the information that appears…or use a tooltip preset for instant styling!
* **Fully customizable marker list** : Customize the marker list as you please : HTML, audios, videos, images,post content…
* **Ready to use** : Need a map NOW? choose a map Layout, click, you are done! Not exactly what you had in mind? No worries!Just edit the layout CSS directly in the
admin!
* **Robust** : LocateAndFilter has been tested with 10 000 markers containing images, videos and audio…and still ran smoothly
* **Responsive & Touch optimized**

* Additional control layers by Bing satellite and Yandex satellite
* import and style KML files
